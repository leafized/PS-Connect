# PS-Connect
[PS Connect] A PlayStation 3 CFW/OFW Mod tool with a unique goal of making a long lasting tool. This project is now open source, all credits to anyone who's code is used, will be documented. Thank you for your interest!

[Current Notes] This version of the tool is [0.1.a] and is available to be used for testing purposes. You are free to decompile as you wish, but note: the tool is mainly developed by me, and the use of public code if needed. 

[Note from Developer] This is my first big tool like this, and a lot of features will be added. This repo will be updated regularly, however the description may not. As of now, it is May 24, 2019.
